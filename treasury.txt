# 8. Treasury Architecture

The Treasury acts as the ecosystem stabilizer.

## Inflows
- Tier allocations  
- Donor contributions  
- Buyback budgets  
- Partner flows  

## Outflows
- Security audits  
- Liquidity reinforcement  
- Development  
- Grants / bounties  
- Governance-funded roles  

Treasury decisions = DAO-controlled.
