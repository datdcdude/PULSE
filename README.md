# PULSE
PULSE Protocol is a decentralized regenerative tier engine built on deterministic smart contracts. Participants progress through fixed tiers, retain permanent positions, and activate reinvestment loops. Once autonomy thresholds are met, tiers self-sustain without extraction, emissions, or profit guarantees.
