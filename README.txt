Pulse Protocol Documentation  
Regenerative Tier-Based Economic Engine Powered by $PULSE  
Version 1.1

Pulse Protocol is a decentralized, regenerative, non-custodial tier engine that converts participation into governance through deterministic smart contract mechanics. It is not an investment scheme, does not promise returns, and does not offer securities. All value flow is generated through transparent participation cycles and DAO governance.
