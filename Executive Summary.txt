Pulse Protocol is a decentralized, non-custodial, tier-based coordination system designed to restore:
circulation
sustainability and,
participatory governance to digital economic activity.
At its core, Pulse Protocol replaces extractive, hype-driven token models with a deterministic, regenerative architecture where participation advances through:
structured tiers
value continuously recirculates, 
and governance authority emerges from engagement rather than capital concentration.
The protocol is governed by the Pulse Protocol DAO and coordinated through the $PULSE token, which functions exclusively as a utility and governance mechanism—not as equity, debt, or a profit-sharing instrument.
Pulse Protocol does not promise financial returns, does not have custody of user assets, and does not operate as an investment product. 
Instead, it provides a programmable framework for participation, coordination, and governance, allowing economic outcomes to emerge organically through transparent rules and market behavior.
