Abstract

Pulse Protocol is a decentralized, regenerative, non-custodial tier engine designed to reverse extractive economic dynamics. 
Participants progress through four tiers—Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum—culminating in a governance credential known as a PulsePass.

The engine uses deterministic smart-contract logic:

- 8-unit Apex cycles  
- 1 reinvestment + 7 new entries  
- Upward tier propulsion  
- Treasury reinforcement  
- Autonomous regenerative patterns  

Pulse Protocol promises no financial returns. It offers a transparent structure that transforms participation into governance rather than speculation into yield.

This documentation describes the full architecture, tokenomics, autonomy theory, economic dynamics, and governance structures supporting the protocol.
