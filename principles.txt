Problem Statement
Modern financial systems—traditional and DeFi—are built on extraction:
Wealth moves upward and stagnates.  
Governance is concentrated at the top.  
Speculative incentives overpower sustainability.  
Tokens inflate without purpose.  
Pulse Protocol resolves these issues by designing:
Regenerative cycles instead of extractive flows  
Participation-earned governance  
Deterministic mechanics instead of discretionary decisions  
Sustainable, non-yield-based ecosystem flow
