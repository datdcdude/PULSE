Economic Opportunity Framework

Pulse Protocol does not provide guaranteed returns.  
It provides structural opportunity surfaces:

- Cycle interaction potential  
- Treasury-funded contributor roles  
- Governance power  
- LP fee exposure  
- Arbitrage opportunities (market-driven)  

Opportunities emerge from participation, not promises.
